Ape Safe: Gnosis Safe tx builder
====================================

Ape Safe allows you to iteratively build complex multi-step Gnosis Safe transactions and safely preview their side effects from the convenience of a locally forked mainnet environment.

It is powered by Brownie_ and builds upon GnosisPy_, extending it with additional capabilities.
This tool has been informally known as Chief Multisig Officer and it has been used at Yearn_ to prepare complex transactions with great success.
